_(Project specific) toll for generating escaping ratios from Vijka results_


This utility takes some [Vijka] results and computes the escaping ratios for each toll/vehicle type/scenario. Optionally, it is also possible to remove from the analysis the OD pairs that did not use the highway on the basis scenario.
